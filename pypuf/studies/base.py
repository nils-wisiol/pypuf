"""
Base module for studies.

pypuf studies can be used to run experiments and analyze the results. Ideally, a study can answer a specific
research question like "How many examples does a training set need to have?" or "What's the success rate of
an attack?".

To run experiments, the pypuf `Experimenter` is used. Results and partial results will be saved to disk.
While and after experiments are run, studies can analyze the results by plotting graphs. This enables the user
to rapidly obtain results that will become more and more exact over time.

In order to implement a study, the `name`, `experiments` and `plot` method should be implemented.

- The `name` method returns a single, constant string that serves as the studies name and is used in file names to
  identify the study.
- The `experiments` method returns an array of Experiments that will be run by the experimenter.
- The `plot` method has access to the (full or partial) results in a `DataFrame` via `self.experimenter.results` and
  analyzes and plots the results.
