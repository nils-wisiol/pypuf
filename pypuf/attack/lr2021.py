    Improved Logistic Regression modeling attack for XOR Arbiter PUFs.

    Based on the attack of RÃ¼hrmair et al. [RSSD10]_, this version uses tensorflow to model XOR Arbiter PUFs based on
    observed challenge-response pairs. Compared to the version used by the original authors, this version is based on
    tensorflow and uses some detail improvements.

        A detailed description of the modifications used in pypuf is currently under consideration for publication.
        This section will be updated as soon as the manuscript is available to the public.
